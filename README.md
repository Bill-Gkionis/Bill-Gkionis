# Hi, I'm Vasilis 👋

Electrical & Electronics Engineering student (University of West Attica) focusing on **hardware design**, **embedded systems**, and **control theory**.  

I enjoy designing PCBs, writing firmware, building test setups, and understanding how things work all the way from physics to code.
